# Producer/Consumer Model

We will need the following pieces of information to construct the model:

1. A callback function for each task.
2. A callback function for the job
3. A state machine:
   1. A producer task that puts items to a work queue
   2. Workers that watch the queue and consume the items
   3. Result handlers that report the result
