# Async/Await

In order to make our code asynchronous, various mechanisms exist.

Some common approaches include:

- Javascript has _promises_ (also async/await)
- Go has _goroutines_ and _channels_
- C# has _async/await_
- ...

The async/await notation allows us to write concurrent code in a manner that looks similar with sequential code.

- Everything that can be executed concurrently needs to be preceded with the keyword _async_
- Whenever we want to access the results of a coroutine, we need to await it.

```py
import asyncio

async def async_sleep():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

```
