# Part 1. Faster Requests

- Take advantage of **persistent HTTP requests**
  - If multiple requests sent to the same host, underlying **TCP** connection can be reused.
- Example: Python **requests**

Using a single `Session` object that reuses the same connection to the host

```py
import requests

s = requests.Session()

...

for idx, user in enumerate(USERNAMES):
    resp = s.get(url = f"https://api.github.com/{user}", headers = headers)
    print(resp.json())

```

## Advantages: Adapters

- Managing requests individually is tedious for things like error handling.
- We may want to treat the response differently depending on the status code of the requests

  - If we get back a _429_ error, it may be wise to implement a backoff strategy to retry after a certain amount of time.
  - If we get back a _403_ or a _401_ error, we may want to try to re-authenticate again before sending a new request.
  - If we get back a certain number of _500_ or _503_ errors, we may want to halt the execution.

- Different servers may require different handling of the requests. Difficult to standarize.

---

- **Adapters** provide a way to handle responses uniformly.
- Implement _retry strategies_ for handling various responses.

```py
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter, Retry

class Adapter(HTTPAdapter):
    _RETRY_STATUS = [
        501,
        502,
        504,
        429
    ]
    _BACKOFF_FACTOR = 0.1
    _TOTAL_RETRIES = 3
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.max_retries = Retry(
            total = self._TOTAL_RETRIES,
            backoff_factor = self._BACKOFF_FACTOR,
            status_forcelist = self._RETRY_STATUS
        )

```
