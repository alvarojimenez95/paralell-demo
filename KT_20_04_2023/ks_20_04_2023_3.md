# Python GIL

---

Python prevents race conditions by providing a Mutex called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which prevents multiple threads from execuring pure Python code simultaneously.

It achieves this implementing a Global Interpreter Lock, which is attached to each Python process. Any thread that spawns in a process needs to aquire this Lock in order to execute code.

Also, swithing between the threads takes a considerable amount of work and may produce undesirable performance results.

## Pure Python Code

By _pure Python_ we need to be concrete as to what Python implementation we refer to. Most Python applications are written in _CPython_, which does implement the GIL, but have APIs for languages that do have pure multithreading.

Libraries like **numpy** or **pandas** take advantage of this and do work _outside_ the Global Interpreted Code. So a way to make faster applications in Python is to write them in a language that is compatible with the Python API that does not have any kind of lock.

## Workaround: Multiprocessing

Multiprocessing involves the usage of multiple cores, and is the truest form of concurrency, as these tasks really happen simultaneously.
