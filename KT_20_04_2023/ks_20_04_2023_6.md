# Producer/Consumer Model Review

So, when should we think to perform tasks asynchronously? As a rule of thumb:

- If we need to perform a large number of tasks
- These tasks are similar but vary in the parameters passed to each task
- There is a benefit in processing a task while we wait for a different task to finish

In this scenario, however, we would not like to spawn $1000$ is we have $1000$ items to process, but rather we would have small number of concurrent tasks processing these $1000$ items asynchronously.

1. A **producer** (or multiple producers) submits work to a **Queue**.
2. A **worker** (or multiple workers) watch the queue for new items:
   - If a new item is available from the queue it **consumes** it.
   - If no more items are available, the queue is empty.

In UiPath, we currently implement 1 Producer - 1 Consumer, but we could potentially have $n$ Producers - $m$ Consumers.

> Despite being able to run multiple Producers or Consumers in UiPath, these need to run in different machines (in general).
